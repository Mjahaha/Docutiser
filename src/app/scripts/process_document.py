letter_text = "Dear Hugh Jackman,\n\nYour portrayal of Wolverine across so many films is legendary. You truly embodied the character's gruff exterior and underlying humanity, making him unforgettable. No one else could have brought such depth and raw power to Logan, and it's a performance that will stand the test of time.\n\nI remember seeing *The Greatest Showman* in theaters with my family, and the joy and inspiration it brought us was truly palpable. We left the cinema buzzing, and the soundtrack became a permanent fixture in our home. Your powerful singing voice is simply astounding; the sheer emotion and control you bring to every musical performance are breathtaking and a true gift.\n\nWhile I've admired so much of your work, I must confess that your performance in *Van Helsing* always left me a little disappointed. I felt the character, despite your efforts, never quite reached the potential I knew you were capable of, and the film itself didn't quite capture your full range.\n\nBeyond your professional achievements, it's always inspiring to see the dedication you show to your family. It's clear that being a good husband and father is incredibly important to you, and that resonates deeply. Your highly acclaimed performance in *Les Mis\u00e9rables*, which garnered such significant industry recognition, showcased a profound depth that truly moved audiences.\n\nI often find myself wondering what incredible project you'll tackle next, and I hold a quiet hope that our paths might one day cross, even for a fleeting moment, to express this appreciation in person.\n\nSincerely, Your fan"
